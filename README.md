This project is a simple demonstration of a Leaderboard implemented in Redis in a Node/Express application.  The current iteration of this application demonstrates the Redis interactions through Mocha tests.  Future development may include an Angular 2 front-end, but the primary focus is on just the interactions with the Redis Database.
